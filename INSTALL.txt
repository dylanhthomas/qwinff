Building QWinFF
==============================

QWinFF uses the Qt Toolkit as its graphical interface. You must install
QtSDK 5.15.2 (LTS) to build QWinFF. Microsoft Windows is only currently supported platform in the version.

For GNU/Linux support, see original project: https://github.com/qwinff/qwinff

QWinFF depends on several external programs at runtime. Currently these
programs are:

  - ffmpeg (required)
  - ffprobe (required)
  - ffplay (optional, for previewing audio/video cutting)
  - sox (optional, for adjusting audio speed)


Building on Windows
-------------------

The following packages are required to build QWinFF on Windows.

  - Qt5 with MinGW (https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)

1 - Install Qt5 and add the paths containing executables
of Qt tools executables to your `PATH`.

2 - Extract the source code to a directory and switch to it.

If you are going to run the app on the same system you build it on, just run `windows_build.bat`
This will build it referencing the Qt libraries on your system.

If you are going to distribute the app, or run it on other computers which may or may not have Qt installed, run `windows_build_portable.bat`
This will copy all the necessary libraries into the build directory, which will then run on any Windows computer.

If the build was successful, the output files will be copied to
`windows_release\`.

Now you can execute QWinFF by clicking on qwinff.exe.
